# The-Weighing-Scale
You are given 8 identical-looking balls, out of which one is slightly heavier than the rest. You also have a balance scale. However, you can only use the scale twice. How can you identify the heavier ball?

Solution:
Here's a step-by-step solution:

Divide the 8 balls into three groups: Group A with 3 balls, Group B with 3 balls, and Group C with 2 balls.
Weigh Group A against Group B using the balance scale.
If both groups weigh the same, the heavier ball is in Group C. Move to step 3.
If Group A is heavier, move to step 3.
If Group B is heavier, interchange the groups (Group A becomes Group B, and vice versa) and move to step 3.
Take the 3 balls from the heavier group (Group A or B) and weigh any 2 of them against each other.
If they weigh the same, the remaining ball is the heavier one.
If one of the balls is heavier, that ball is the one you're looking for.
